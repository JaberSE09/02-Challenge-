# 02-challenge

## Refactoring code to make it more accessible, clean up code, and fix errors. Motivation was to demistrate that the code can be made to work with less code. The problem it solves is to let individuals with screen readers able to view the page with ease. I learned how to troubleshoot code and do anchers inside code to sections of code. Also I learned how to consolidate multiple classes to a sigle css style
